The **Techmaa Student Portal** is an enterprise-grade Student Record Management System (SRMS) designed to streamline academic data administration. Built on a robust full-stack architecture, the system provides a centralized hub for administrators to manage records while offering personalized dashboards for students and faculty.

Unlike standard CRUD applications, this portal incorporates **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, secure **JWT-based authentication** with HttpOnly cookies, and a secondary **Redis-backed OTP login system** for enhanced security.

## 1.🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Role Authentication:** Dedicated access levels and unique UI views for Admin, Staff, and Students.
* **Secure Auth Flow:** Implements JWT tokens stored in HttpOnly cookies and MFA via email-based OTPs.
* **Dynamic Data Filtering:** Advanced administrative search using keyword-based specifications (Name, Roll No, Department, etc.).
* **Automated Reporting:** Generate and download formatted Excel reports using **Apache POI**.
* **Data Integrity:** Implements **"Soft Deletes"** to preserve database history.
* **Responsive UI:** A modern dashboard built with **Tailwind CSS** and real-time notifications.

1.  **Backend (Layered):**
    * **Controllers:** REST API endpoints handling request/response mapping.
    * **Services:** Business logic and transactional management.
    * **Repositories:** Interface for JPA-based database interactions.
2.  **Frontend (Component-Based):**
    * **Context:** Global state management for authentication and notifications.
    * **Services:** API abstraction layer using the Fetch API.

## 8. Usage Guide
1. **Administrative Setup**: Register an admin account via /register/admin.

2. **Student Onboarding**: Admins can register students from the dashboard or students can self-register.

3. **Authentication**: Users can choose between secure password login or OTP-based login (requires Redis and SMTP configuration).

4. **Data Export**: As an Admin, use the filter bar to isolate records and click "Export to Excel" to download the .xlsx report.
